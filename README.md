## Comments for HW1 -- Chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! Your assignments ends up with a "97", with "-5" for your wrong answers in Q3, please try again to get the maximum on "35"; "+2" for your English comments/remarks in script. Keep going!

## Comments for HW2 -- Chenyy
Godd job! I shall give you "100" this time.
Here are some minor comments.
(1)Try not to show the reports with several warnings, which kind of mess up your report. Please find some useful massage to avoid or turn off the warnings. For example, the following link here might be helpful for those _SettingWithCopyWarning_. https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning/ (2) Try to add more comments to better describe the logical flow in your work.
